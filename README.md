# Theoretical Biochemistry Group 

The Theoretical Biochemistry Group (GBQT), researches at the microscopic level photochemical, photophysical, physical, or chemical processes in small molecules and proteins using computational simulations. The methods depend on the type of problem and the size of the system. To study processes in small molecules, a wide range of quantum mechanical (QM) methods are used: semiempirical methods, density functional theory, post-Hartree-Fock methods such as MP2 and Coupled Cluster. Molecular mechanics (MM) and quantum mechanics (QM) methods are used to study processes in large molecules such as proteins. Chemotyping and QSAR methods are also implemented.
